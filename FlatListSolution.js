The solution is to provide a unique `key` prop to each item in the `data` array passed to the `FlatList`.  This key should be a unique identifier for each item, preferably an ID from your data source.  If you don't have a unique ID, you can use the index as a last resort, but this is less efficient and can lead to problems if the data array is modified.  Example:

```javascript
<FlatList
  data={[{ id: '1', title: 'Item 1' }, { id: '2', title: 'Item 2' }]}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.title}</Text>}
  keyExtractor={item => item.id}
/>
```
In this example, the `keyExtractor` function uses the `id` property as the unique key.  If you are using the index, remember that it must be stable and not change between renders.  Avoid this approach if your data source may be re-ordered or filtered frequently.
