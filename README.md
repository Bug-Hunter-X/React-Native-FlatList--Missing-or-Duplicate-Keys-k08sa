This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native's FlatList component: using duplicate or missing keys for list items.  The `FlatListBug.js` file shows the incorrect implementation, leading to unexpected rendering or crashes.  `FlatListSolution.js` provides the corrected version, highlighting the importance of unique keys for optimal performance and correct behavior.  This example uses a simple array of objects, but the principle applies to any data source used with FlatList.
